# hello-world
Meet me and other general info / musings

Hi, I’m @AlyssaKropp 👋 

- 👀  I’m interested in co-creation/design, sustainability, and design for/to prevent disasters. 
- 🌱  I’m currently learning how design is utilized in a technical setting, since I come from a more humanities background (see below) 
- 💞️  Feel free to reach out!

I'm a designer with a background in interanational development. Before finding design, I worked around the world on health topics (particularly around eyes), evaluating USAID projects, countering violent extremism, and more. During all this work, I realized what I was doing (and what I wanted to do) more aligned with design, so I went to school, pivoted a bit, and here we are. 

You can find more about my past projects at alyssakropp.com

Otherwise, I LOVE vegetarian asian food and try to find the best of it around NYC, reading in the park, and DJing on the radio or out at clubs.
