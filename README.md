# hello-world
Meet me and other general info / musings

I'm Alyssa (wave)

I'm a designer with a background in interanational development. Before finding design, I worked around the world on health topics (particularly around eyes), evaluating USAID projects, countering violent extremism, and more. During all this work, I realized what I was doing (and what I wanted to do) more aligned with design, so I went to school, pivoted a bit, and here we are.

Otherwise, I LOVE vegetarian asian food and try to find the best of it around NYC, reading in the park, and DJing on the radio or out at clubs.
